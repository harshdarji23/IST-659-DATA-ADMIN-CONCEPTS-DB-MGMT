# IST-659-DATA-ADMIN-CONCEPTS-DB-MGMT
Project:
The project focusses on developing a database for cricket league which is one of the biggest sport in the world. There exists a system which stores details about the matches but fails to take minute details about players and their skills. The main purpose of this database management system is to hold information about everyone involved with the cricket. This database will help team owners to keep a record of matches, teams, and players shinning in the tournament. This database plans eliminate administrative work and provide records and statistics of players.  

I have friends who bet on Cricket, my aim through this project was to give them insights about teams and players which would help them to make informed and calculated bets.

I am glad I was able to help them to make some money :)
